# Contribution Guide

Contributions are welcomed!

## fix code

In principle, the following flow will be passed.

1. creating an issue
2. creating a Pull Request
3. merge after Review

## create an issue

- First, check if an equivalent Issue already exists.
- If you put multiple elements in one issue, the work period will be prolonged. If it's a relevant factor, consider creating a milestone as a general rule.

## create a Pull-Request

- First, complete the issue creation.
- Do not create with the working branch name as the title.
- If you have an Issue that you want to close at the same time as merge, don't forget to write `fix # <Issue Index>`.
